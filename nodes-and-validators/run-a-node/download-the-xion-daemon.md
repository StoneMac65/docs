# Download the Xion Daemon

We provide pre-built versions of the `xiond` binary.&#x20;

This section shows how to avail yourself of these versions, should you prefer.

{% hint style="info" %}
:warning: **Development environment**

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) internally at Burnt Labs.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with these technologies, and have a pre-existing installation on your workstation.

Adequate installation and configuration of your environment is out of scope. Please refer to the [appropriate](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) [documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for assistance.
{% endhint %}

## Download the image from Docker Hub

- We publish Docker images to Docker Hub on every commit to `main`.
- The image versions are tagged with the short Git SHA.
- We do not use the `latest` tag, to avoid confusion and mistakes.

```
$ docker pull burntnetwork/xion:sha-34c82a9
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For more up to date tags checkout the docker hub page for this image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/burntnetwork/xion/tags)
{% endhint %}

## Obtain a shell in the Docker container

- We can now invoke the `xiond` binary inside the container.

```
$ docker run -ti burntnetwork/xion:sha-34c82a9 /bin/bash
# xiond version
# xiond version --long
# xiond --help
```
